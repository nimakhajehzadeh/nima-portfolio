## Projects
### Hip(Diagnosis of pelvic bone damage)

HIP - Pelvic Bone Damage Diagnosis HIP, short for "Diagnosis of pelvic bone damage by MRI image," stands as a testament to the transformative capabilities of AI in the medical field. This project leverages image processing and deep learning techniques to address a critical need in diagnostic medicine, specifically the accurate assessment of pelvic bone injuries through MRI imaging. The intricacies of this task become apparent when considering the complexity of pelvic bone structures and the nuanced nature of damage patterns. Our AI-driven solution begins with a meticulous preprocessing phase, where advanced image processing algorithms are employed to enhance the quality of MRI scans and isolate the relevant anatomical structures. Deep learning models, tailored to the task at hand, then take center stage. These models are not only adept at identifying normal pelvic bone structures but also excel at recognizing and classifying abnormalities indicative of damage. The extensive training regimen, which involves a diverse corpus of MRI scans, enables our models to achieve levels of diagnostic accuracy previously unattainable. What sets our project apart is its potential to revolutionize the field of radiology and diagnostics. By providing clinicians with a powerful tool capable of swiftly and accurately identifying pelvic bone injuries, we empower medical professionals to make informed decisions rapidly, ultimately enhancing patient care outcomes. In conclusion, HIP represents the synergy of medical expertise and AI innovation, and it is poised to redefine diagnostic processes in a manner that elevates patient care to new heights. This project exemplifies the transformative potential of AI in healthcare and demonstrates our unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of technological advancement in service to humanity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
